# Wetcon OPC UA for PACTware

This repository contains 
* the [OPC UA Server PACTware Plugin](https://github.com/wetcon/OPCUA4PACTware/tree/master/src/Wetcon.PactwarePlugin.OpcUaServer.Plugin) for [PACTware 5.0](https://pactware.com/) which implements an OPC UA server to provide DI compatible access to Device DTMs 
* a [sample console application](https://github.com/wetcon/OPCUA4PACTware/tree/master/src/Wetcon.OpcUaClient.2AzureIOT) that demonstrates how to read device parameters from the OPC UA Server and publish them to [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/).
* a [sample console application](https://github.com/wetcon/OPCUA4PACTware/tree/master/src/Wetcon.OpcUaClient.2AWSIOT) that demonstrates how to read device parameters from the OPC UA Server and publish them to [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/).

# Wetcon OPC UA Server PACTware Plugin

**Features**
* It implements the OPC UA [Device Integration](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture/part-100-device-information-model/) (DI) information model
* Retrieves, reads and writes specific device Offline Parameters using *DtmSingleInstanceDataAccess* and *DtmParameter* interfaces
* Retrieves, reads and writes Online Parameters using *DtmSingleDeviceDataAccess* interface
* The transfer of Parameters between offline nodes and the physical device is supported by exposing a *TransferServicesType* providing appropriate methods
* As not all DTMs expose process data via these interfaces, IO Link process parameters are exemplary read using a FdtCommunication.TransactionRequest

## Getting Started

**Installer**

An installer for this plugin can be conveniently downloaded from the [wetcon website](https://www.wetcon.net/fdi-fdt-pactware-opc-ua/) if you don't want to build from source. Download and execute the installer, and follow its instructions to install the plugin.

**Debug / build from source**

* Open and build the Solution in Debug release configuration with Visual Studio.
* Run `src\Wetcon.PactwarePlugin.OpcUaServer.Plugin\Wetcon.PactwarePlugin.OpcUaServer_x64.bat` to install the debug build in PACTware.

After the next start of PACTware, you should be able to see the already loaded plugin in the  **Add-in Manager** *(Main Menu | Extras | Add-ins)*.

## Configuration (optional)

**Change OPC Server Uri using plugin UI**

Select the plugin in the Add-in manager list and press the **Options** button on the right in order to setup the the OPC UA Server Uri. The default Uri is `opc.tcp://localhost:48032`. You can edit the url in the corresponding text field and press **Ok**. Restart PACTware for this change to take effect.

**Configure additional OPC UA settings and security in the configuration file**

You can edit more OPC UA settings like security, transport quotas and server configurations by locating and editing the `WetconOpcUaServer.Config.xml` file. You can find it in the installation directory or in the `bin/debug` folder of the project if you built the plugin from source. 

**Location of certificates**

Each OPC UA application installation must have an application instance certificate which identifies the application and the machine the application is running on.

By default, the plugin uses a certificate directory store located at `${APPDATA}\wetcon\PACTwarePlugins\OpcUaServer\Certificates\own\`. The _certs_ subdirectory is intended to contain the certificates whereas the _private_ subdirectory contains the private keys. If you want to use your own certificate, make sure to copy the public and private key to the appropriate folders of the certificate directory store and adapt the `WetconOpcUaServer.Config.xml` file accordingly. If the plugin is started for the first time (and no own certificate was provided by an administrator), it will create its own certificate and save it to the directory store.

Trusted (client) certificates are kept in this location: `${APPDATA}\wetcon\PACTwarePlugins\OpcUaServer\Certificates\trusted\certs\`.

It is also possible to use a windows certificate store instead of the directory store.

A convenient tool to administer the application configuration and certificates is the [UA Configuration Tool](http://opcfoundation.github.io/UA-.NETStandard/help/ua_configuration_tool.htm).

**Local Discovery Server**

If you want to enable registering with a Local Discovery Server (LDS), set the value of `<MaxRegistrationInterval>` in the configuration file to a value greater than zero.

## Usage

Start PACTware and open a project with devices.

![PACTware](src/Wetcon.PactwarePlugin.OpcUaServer.Plugin/doc/pactwaredevice.png "PACTware")

The plugin automatically starts the OPC UA Server in the background which can be connected to with a OPC UA Client. In the screenshot below, we use the official [OPC UA .Net Standard Reference Client Sample](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard).

![OPC UA Client](src/Wetcon.PactwarePlugin.OpcUaServer.Plugin/doc/opcclient.png "OPC UA Client")

The devices are listed under the DeviseSet node. Select a device to get, read or write its online and offline parameters. Also the offline device exposes a *Transfer* node (being a type of *TransferServicesType*) implementing the methods

* _TransferFromDevice_
* _TransferToDevice_
* _FetchTransferResultData_

that can be consumed by the client. The _FetchTransferResultData_ can only be called after a _TransferFromDevice_ or _TransferToDevice_ invocation using the returned _TransferId_ output parameter.
